# Chapter 1: Machine Learning for Trading - From Idea to Execution 

### **Fundamental Law of Active Management**
- key to generating alpha is having accurate return forecasts combined with the ability to act on these forecasts 
#### **Information Ratio (IR)**
- value of active management 
- ratio of the return difference between the porfolio and a benchmark to the volatility of those returns
- Further Approximation: 
    - **Information Coefficient (IC):** measures quality of forecasts as their rank correlates with outcomes 
    - Square root of the **breadth of a strategy** expressed as the number of independent bets on these forecasts 


### Other Terms to expound on 
- Market Microstructure
- Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) 



### 2001/2008 affected investors 
- Rise in low-cost passive investment vehicles
- fomration of ETFs
- Active Mutual Funds to Passive ETFs
- Hedge Fund Fees Dropping 

### Equity Markets Forefront of Electronic Trading 


### **Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)** are automated **Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)**
- match buy-and-sell orders at specified prices
- primarily for equities and currencies
- registered broker-dealers 

### **Dark Pools** are private ATS
- allow institutional investors to trade large orders without publicly revealing their information 
- Do not publish pre-trade bids and offers 
- trade prices only become public after execution 
- often housed within large banks
- SEC regulated 


### Algorithms for Cost-Effective Execution 
- Automated trading emerged around 2000 as a *SELL-SIDE* tool aimed at cost-effective execution 
    - Broke down orders into smaller, sequenced chunks to limit their market impact 
- Spread to buy-side and became more and more sophisticated 


### **Direct Market Access (DMA)**
- gives a trader greater control over execution 
- allowed to send orders directly to the exchange 
- *Sponsored Acess* - removes pre-trade risk controls by the brokers 
- Forms Basis for **High Frequency Trading (HFT)**
    - automated tradex executed with low latency in microsecond range 
    - participants hold positions for very short periods 
    - detecting and exploiting inefficiencies in the market microstructure 
    - Passive Strategies: arbitrage trading 
    - Aggressive Strategies: 
        - **Order Anticipation:** (aka liquidity detection)
            - Algorithms Submit Small Exploratory Orders to Detect Hidden Liquidyt from Large Institutional Investors 
            - Trade Ahead of a Large Order to Benefit From Subsequent Price Movements 
        - **Momentum Ignition:**
            - Algorithm Executing and Cancelling a Series of Orders to Spoof other HFT Algorithms into Buying (or selling)
